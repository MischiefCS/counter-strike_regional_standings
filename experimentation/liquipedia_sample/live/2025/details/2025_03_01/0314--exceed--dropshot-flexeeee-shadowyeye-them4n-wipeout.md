### Roster Details<br />
Team Name: Exceed<br />
Roster: DropShot, flexeeee, Shadowyeye, TheM4N, wipeout<br />
Global Rank: [314](../../standings_global_2025_03_01.md)<br />
<br />
Region: [Asia]( ../../standings_asia_2025_03_01.md)<br />
Regional Rank: [48]( ../../standings_asia_2025_03_01.md)<br />
<br />
Final Rank Value:  631.4<br />
<br />
Final Rank Value (631.4) = Starting Rank Value (632.0) + Head To Head Adjustments (-0.6)<br />

#### Starting Rank Value<br />
To figure out a rosters's Starting Rank Value, first take the average of these four factors:<br />
- Bounty Offered: 0.274[<sup>1</sup>](#table2)
- Bounty Collected: 0.158[<sup>2</sup>](#table1)
- Opponent Network: 0.000[<sup>2</sup>](#table1)
- LAN Wins: 0.039[<sup>2</sup>](#table1)

The average of these factors is 0.118<br />
<br />
Next, take the maximum and minimum average across all teams and compute the following:<br />
- 400 + ( ( Roster_Average - Min_Average ) / ( Max_Average - Min_Average ) ) * 1600 = 632.0
- 400 + ( ( 0.118 - 0.000 ) / ( 0.812 - 0.000 ) ) * 1600 = 632.0


#### Factors<br />
Below you can see a table of all of the matches that contributed to this roster's Final Rank Value.<br />
Note:<br />

- For Bounty Collected, Opponent Network, and LAN Wins, we consider only the ten best results over the past 6 months.
- Raw values for those factors are multiplied by Age Weight. Bounty and Opponent Network values are also multiplied by Event Weight. The adjusted value is shown in parenthesis.
- The final value for a factor is the total of its adjusted values divided by 10. Bounty Collected is further scaled by the curve function[<sup>3</sup>](#curveFunction)
- Head to head adjustments are based on rosters' starting rank values. The results shown below are adjusted by Age Weight and not Event Weight

To calculate a roster's Bounty Offered:<br />

- First, take the sum of their top 10 scaled winnings ($747.32)
- Divide that value by the 5th highest value among all rosters ($336,543.84)
- The final value (0.00) is scaled by the curve function.[<sup>3</sup>](#curveFunction)

Top ten winnings for this roster:<br />

| Event Date | Age Weight | Prize Winnings | Scaled Winnings |
| :- | -: | :- | :- |
| 2024-09-29 |      0.178 | $4,089.70      | $727.34         |
