Final Rank Value:  1221.4<br />
<br />
Final Rank Value (1221.4) = Starting Rank Value (1216.3) + Head To Head Adjustments (5.2)<br />

#### Starting Rank Value<br />
To figure out a rosters's Starting Rank Value, first take the average of these four factors:<br />
- Bounty Offered: 0.517[<sup>1</sup>](#table2)
- Bounty Collected: 0.441[<sup>2</sup>](#table1)
- Opponent Network: 0.041[<sup>2</sup>](#table1)
- LAN Wins: 0.410[<sup>2</sup>](#table1)

The average of these factors is 0.352<br />
<br />
Next, take the maximum and minimum average across all teams and compute the following:<br />
- 400 + ( ( Roster_Average - Min_Average ) / ( Max_Average - Min_Average ) ) * 1600 = 1216.3
- 400 + ( ( 0.352 - 0.000 ) / ( 0.691 - 0.000 ) ) * 1600 = 1216.3


#### Factors<br />
Below you can see a table of all of the matches that contributed to this roster's Final Rank Value.<br />
Note:<br />

- For Bounty Collected, Opponent Network, and LAN Wins, we consider only the ten best results over the past 6 months.
- Raw values for those factors are multiplied by Age Weight. Bounty and Opponent Network values are also multiplied by Event Weight. The adjusted value is shown in parenthesis.
- The final value for a factor is the total of its adjusted values divided by 10. Bounty Collected is further scaled by the curve function[<sup>3</sup>](#curveFunction)
- Head to head adjustments are based on rosters' starting rank values. The results shown below are adjusted by Age Weight and not Event Weight

To calculate a roster's Bounty Offered:<br />

- First, take the sum of their top 10 scaled winnings ($10,228.82)
- Divide that value by the 5th highest value among all rosters ($87,854.17)
- The final value (0.12) is scaled by the curve function.[<sup>3</sup>](#curveFunction)

Top ten winnings for this roster:<br />

| Event Date | Age Weight | Prize Winnings | Scaled Winnings |
| :- | -: | :- | :- |
| 2025-02-09 |      0.444 | $16,000.00     | $7,111.11       |
| 2024-12-15 |      0.069 | $45,000.00     | $3,117.71       |
